# Getting Started

Welcome to Zodula! This guide will help you set up your first Zodula application and understand the core concepts.

## What is Zodula?

Zodula is a modern full-stack framework for building business applications. It's a Bun + TypeScript reimagining of the Frappe framework with:

- **Type-safe DocType definitions and queries**
- **Fast dev workflow powered by Bun**
- **Built-in migrations, fixtures, and OpenAPI docs**
- **Complete Solution** - Backend API + frontend UI + admin interface
- **Zero-Config Admin** - Auto-generated admin interface
- **Enterprise Features** - User roles, permissions, and security

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Bun v1.2.x+** - [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- **Nailgun CLI** - [Install Nailgun](https://github.com/zodula/nailgun)

## Installation

Create a new Zodula application:

```bash
nailgun create my-app --branch v0
```

This will create a new project with the latest v0 branch of Zodula.

## Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
cd my-app
nailgun dev
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000` with:

- **OpenAPI JSON**: `GET /openapi.json`
- **API Reference UI**: `GET /openapi`

## Key Commands

Zodula exposes commands through `nailgun`. Here are the most common ones:

```bash
# Prepare workspace (generate types)
nailgun prepare

# Generate migrations (diff DocTypes vs DB)
nailgun generate

# Apply migrations, push schema, and load fixtures
nailgun migrate

# Create admin user
nailgun admin create-user --email me@example.com --password secret --roles "System Admin"
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about [DocTypes](/doctypes) - the core building blocks
- Explore the [API Reference](/api-reference) 
- Check out [Examples](/examples) for common patterns
- Read about [Deployment](/deployment) for production setup

## Important Notice

**Version 0 is currently in experimental development.** This version undergoes rapid changes and may include breaking changes between releases. Database migrations may result in data loss during schema updates.

**This version is not recommended for production environments.** Please use only in development projects where data can be easily restored or recreated.
