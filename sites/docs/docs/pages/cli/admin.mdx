## Description

The `admin` command provides access to administrative functions and system management tools for your Zodula project. It includes subcommands for user management and other administrative tasks.

## What It Does

### create-user

The `create-user` subcommand:

1. Starts up the Zodula server
2. Validates that the user doesn't already exist
3. Hashes the provided password
4. Creates a new user with the specified email and password
5. Assigns the specified roles to the user
6. Sets the user as active

## User Creation Process

```bash
$ nailgun admin create-user --email admin@example.com --password secret123 --roles "Administrator,User"

✓ User created successfully
✓ Email: admin@example.com
✓ Roles: Administrator, User
✓ Status: Active
```

## Roles

Roles are specified as a comma-separated list:

```bash
--roles "Administrator,User,Manager"
```

## When to Use

Use the `admin` command when you need to:

- Create system administrators
- Set up initial users
- Manage user accounts
- Perform administrative tasks

## Important Notes

- User emails must be unique
- Passwords are automatically hashed
- Users are created as active by default
- Roles are assigned during user creation
- The command will exit after completion

## Security Considerations

- Use strong passwords for administrative accounts
- Limit administrative access to trusted users
- Regularly review user roles and permissions
- Keep administrative accounts secure

## Tips

- Create your first administrator user after initial setup
- Use descriptive role names
- Test user creation in development first
- Keep track of administrative users
- Use secure passwords for all accounts

## Troubleshooting

If user creation fails:

1. Check that the email is unique
2. Verify the email format is valid
3. Ensure roles are properly formatted
4. Check that the server is running
5. Verify database connectivity
