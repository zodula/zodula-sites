# install-app

Install an app from a GitHub repository.

## Usage

```bash
nailgun install-app <app> [options]
```

## Arguments

- `<app>` - The app to install in format `@username/appname`

## Options

- `-b, --branch <branch>` - The branch to install (default: "master")
- `-f, --force` - Force install even if the app already exists

## Description

The `install-app` command clones and installs a Zodula app from a GitHub repository. It handles dependency installation and setup automatically.

## App Format

The app argument must be in the format `@username/appname`:

```bash
nailgun install-app @myusername/my-awesome-app
```

## Examples

### Basic Installation

```bash
nailgun install-app @myusername/my-awesome-app
```

### Install from Specific Branch

```bash
nailgun install-app @myusername/my-awesome-app --branch develop
```

### Force Install (Overwrite Existing)

```bash
nailgun install-app @myusername/my-awesome-app --force
```

## What It Does

1. Validates the app format and requirements
2. Fetches the remote package.json to get app details
3. Checks if the app already exists (unless `--force` is used)
4. Clones the repository to the `apps/` directory
5. Installs dependencies with `bun install`
6. Sets up the app in your project

## Installation Process

```bash
$ nailgun install-app @myusername/my-awesome-app

✓ Fetching package.json from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myusername/my-awesome-app/refs/heads/master/package.json
✓ Cloning repository...
✓ Installing dependencies...
✓ App installed successfully!
```

## Force Installation

When using `--force`, the command will:

1. Remove the existing app directory
2. Remove `node_modules` and `bun.lock`
3. Clone the fresh repository
4. Install dependencies

## Requirements

- The repository must be publicly accessible on GitHub
- The repository must have a valid `package.json`
- The app name in `package.json` must match the expected format
- You must have Git installed and configured

## When to Use

Use `install-app` when:

- You want to add a community app to your project
- You're setting up a project with existing apps
- You need to install apps from specific branches
- You're updating an existing app installation

## Tips

- Always check the app's documentation before installing
- Use specific branches for development versions
- Test apps in development before production
- Keep your installed apps updated
- Use `--force` carefully as it will overwrite existing data

## Troubleshooting

If installation fails:

1. Verify the repository exists and is accessible
2. Check that the username starts with `@`
3. Ensure the app name is correct
4. Verify you have Git installed
5. Check your internet connection
6. Ensure you have write permissions to the project directory

## Example Output

```bash
$ nailgun install-app @zodula/example-app

✓ Fetching package.json from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zodula/example-app/refs/heads/master/package.json
✓ Cloning repository to apps/example-app...
✓ Installing dependencies...
✓ App example-app installed successfully!
```
