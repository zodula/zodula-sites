# backup

Create a backup of your Zodula data files.

## Usage

```bash
nailgun backup
```

## Description

The `backup` command creates a timestamped backup of your `.zodula_data` directory. This is useful for preserving your database and configuration before making changes.

## What It Does

1. Checks for the `.zodula_data` directory
2. Creates a `.zodula_backup` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Creates a timestamped ZIP backup
4. Shows backup information and size
5. Lists existing backups

## Backup Location

Backups are stored in:
```
.zodula_backup/
├── zodula-backup-2023-12-21T10-30-45-123Z.zip
├── zodula-backup-2023-12-20T15-20-30-456Z.zip
└── ...
```

## Example Output

```bash
$ nailgun backup

## When to Use

Create backups before:

- Running migrations
- Making major changes
- Updating Zodula
- Deploying to production
- Experimenting with new features

## Backup Contents

The backup includes:
- Database files
- Configuration files
- User data
- Application state
- All `.zodula_data` contents

## Important Notes

- Backups are created as ZIP files
- Each backup is timestamped
- Existing backup files are excluded from new backups
- The command will exit after completion

## Tips

- Create regular backups before major changes
- Store backups in a safe location
- Test backup restoration periodically
- Consider automated backup schedules
- Keep multiple backup versions

## Troubleshooting

If backup fails:
- Check disk space availability
- Ensure write permissions to the directory
- Verify the `.zodula_data` directory exists
- Check for any file locks
