# migrate

Apply database migrations to update your database schema.

## Usage

```bash
nailgun migrate
```

## Description

The `migrate` command applies all pending database migrations to update your database schema. It runs migrations, applies fixtures, and handles predefined data.

## What It Does

1. Starts up the Zodula server
2. Applies all pending migrations
3. Applies fixtures (sample data)
4. Applies predefined data
5. Updates the database schema

## Migration Process

The migration process includes:

- **Schema Changes**: Updates database tables and columns
- **Data Migrations**: Transforms existing data as needed
- **Fixtures**: Applies sample/test data
- **Predefined Data**: Sets up initial system data

## When to Use

Run `migrate` when:

- After creating new doctypes
- After modifying existing doctypes
- After generating new migrations
- When setting up a fresh database
- After pulling changes that include migrations

## Example

```bash
$ nailgun migrate

✓ Applying migrations...
✓ Applying fixtures...
✓ Applying predefined data...
✓ Migration completed successfully
```

## Important Notes

- Always backup your database before running migrations in production
- Test migrations in a development environment first
- Some migrations may be irreversible
- The command will exit after completion

## Troubleshooting

If migrations fail:

1. Check the error messages in the terminal
2. Ensure your database is accessible
3. Verify migration files are valid
4. Consider restoring from backup if needed

## Tips

- Run `nailgun generate` before `migrate` to create new migrations
- Use `nailgun backup` before major migrations
- Test migrations in development first
- Keep your database backups up to date
