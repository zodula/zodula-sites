# push

Push migrations to the project and apply predefined data.

## Usage

```bash
nailgun push [options]
```

## Options

- `-d, --dryRun` - Dry run and show interactive prompts

## Description

The `push` command applies migrations to your project and handles predefined data. It's similar to `migrate` but includes additional steps for pushing changes and applying fixtures.

## What It Does

1. Starts up the Zodula server
2. Pushes migrations to the project
3. Applies predefined data
4. Applies fixtures (sample data)
5. Handles database schema updates

## Dry Run Mode

Use the `--dryRun` option to preview what changes will be made without actually applying them:

```bash
nailgun push --dryRun
```

This will:
- Show you what migrations will be applied
- Display interactive prompts for confirmation
- Not make any actual changes to the database

## Example

```bash
$ nailgun push

✓ Starting up server...
✓ Pushing migrations...
✓ Applying predefine...
✓ Applying fixtures...
✓ Push completed successfully
```

## When to Use

Use `push` when:

- You want to apply migrations with additional data setup
- You need to apply predefined system data
- You want to ensure fixtures are applied
- You're setting up a fresh environment
- You need to sync database changes

## Difference from Migrate

While `migrate` focuses on schema changes, `push` includes:

- **Predefined Data**: Applies system-level predefined data
- **Fixtures**: Ensures sample data is applied
- **Additional Setup**: Handles extra configuration steps

## Important Notes

- The command will exit after completion
- Changes are applied to the main database
- Predefined data is applied within a transaction
- Fixtures are applied after migrations

## Tips

- Use `--dryRun` to preview changes first
- Run `push` after major schema changes
- Ensure your database is accessible
- Consider backing up before running `push`
- Test in development before production

## Troubleshooting

If push fails:

1. Check the error messages in the terminal
2. Ensure your database is accessible
3. Verify migration files are valid
4. Check for any data conflicts
5. Consider restoring from backup if needed
