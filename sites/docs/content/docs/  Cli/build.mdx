# build

Build the project for production deployment.

## Usage

```bash
nailgun build
```

## Description

The `build` command compiles and prepares your Zodula project for production deployment. It runs build scripts for all apps in your project.

## What It Does

1. Starts up the Zodula server
2. Loads all apps in the project
3. Runs build scripts for each app
4. Compiles TypeScript and other assets
5. Prepares production-ready files

## Build Process

For each app, the build process:

1. Looks for a build script at `scripts/build`
2. Imports and runs the build script if found
3. Compiles TypeScript files
4. Bundles assets and dependencies
5. Optimizes for production

## App Build Scripts

Each app can have its own build script at `apps/your-app/scripts/build.ts`:

```typescript
export default async function build() {
    // Your custom build logic here
    console.log('Building app...');
    
    // Example: Compile TypeScript
    // Example: Bundle assets
    // Example: Optimize for production
}
```

## When to Use

Run `build` when:

- Preparing for production deployment
- Creating production builds
- Before deploying to servers
- When you need optimized assets
- As part of CI/CD pipelines

## Example

```bash
$ nailgun build

✓ Starting build process...
✓ Building app: my-app
✓ Building app: another-app
✓ Build completed successfully
```

## Production Considerations

- Build outputs are optimized for production
- Assets are minified and compressed
- TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript
- Dependencies are bundled efficiently

## Tips

- Run `build` before deploying to production
- Test your build locally before deployment
- Use build outputs for production servers
- Keep build scripts simple and focused
- Consider using CI/CD for automated builds
