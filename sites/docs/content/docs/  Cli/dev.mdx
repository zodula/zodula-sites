# dev

Start the development server with hot reloading.

## Usage

```bash
nailgun dev
```

## Description

The `dev` command starts the Zodula development server with file watching enabled. This allows you to develop your application with automatic reloading when files change.

## What It Does

1. Prepares TSX pages for development
2. Spawns a Bun process running the development server
3. Enables file watching for automatic reloading
4. Inherits stdout and stderr for real-time logging

## Development Server

The development server runs on the default port and provides:

- **Hot Reloading**: Automatically restarts when you make changes to your code
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript compilation and type checking
- **Error Reporting**: Real-time error reporting in the terminal
- **File Watching**: Monitors your project files for changes

## Example

```bash
$ nailgun dev

✓ Development server started
✓ Watching for file changes...
✓ Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

## Tips

- Keep the terminal open while developing to see real-time logs
- The server will automatically restart when you save changes
- Check the terminal for any compilation errors or warnings
- Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the development server
