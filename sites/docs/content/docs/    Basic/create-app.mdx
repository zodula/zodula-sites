title: Create App
description: The `scaffold` command is the fastest way to create new apps, doctypes, and actions in your Zodula project. It provides an interactive CLI that guides you through the setup process.
---
## Quick Start

```bash
nailgun scaffold
```

This will prompt you to choose what you'd like to scaffold:
- **App** - Create a new application
- **Doctype** - Create a new document type
- **Action** - Create a new API action

## Scaffold App

Create a new application with the following command:

```bash
nailgun scaffold app
```

Or simply run `nailgun scaffold` and select "App" from the menu.

### Interactive Setup

The scaffold command will prompt you for:

1. **App name** - Must start with lowercase letter and contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
2. **App description** - Optional description of your application

### Generated Structure

When you scaffold an app, the following structure is created:

```
apps/your-app-name/
├── package.json
├── index.ts
├── src/
│   └── server/
│       └── index.ts
├── doctype/
│   └── core/
├── actions/
├── migrations/
└── fixtures/
```

### Example

```bash
$ nailgun scaffold app

? App name: my-awesome-app
? App description: A sample application

✓ App my-awesome-app created successfully!
Next steps:
1. cd apps/my-awesome-app
2. Run 'nailgun prepare' to generate types
3. Run 'nailgun dev' to start development
```

## Scaffold Doctype

Create a new document type within an existing app:

```bash
nailgun scaffold doctype
```

### Interactive Setup

The scaffold command will prompt you for:

1. **Select app** - Choose from existing apps
2. **Doctype name** - Must start with uppercase letter (e.g., Customer, Product)
3. **Domain** - Folder name (default: "core")
4. **Label** - Display name (defaults to doctype name)
5. **Is submittable** - Whether this doctype can be submitted

### Generated Doctype

The scaffold creates a basic doctype with a `name` field:

```typescript
export default $doctype<"app__DoctypeName">({
    name: {
        type: "Text",
        label: "Name",
        required: 1,
        unique: 1,
        in_list_view: 1
    },
    // Add more fields as needed
}, {
    label: "Doctype Name",
    is_submittable: 0,
    search_fields: "name"
})
```

## Scaffold Action

Create a new API action within an existing app:

```bash
nailgun scaffold action
```

### Interactive Setup

The scaffold command will prompt you for:

1. **Select app** - Choose from existing apps
2. **Action name** - Must start with lowercase letter (e.g., create_user, get_products)
3. **Module name** - Grouping for actions (default: "core")

### Generated Action

The scaffold creates a basic action with request/response schemas:

```typescript
import { z } from "zodula";

export const action_name = $action(async ctx => {
    // TODO: Implement action_name logic
    return ctx.json({
        message: "action_name action executed"
    });
}, {
    // TODO: Add request/response schemas
    response: {
        200: z.object({
            message: z.string()
        })
    }
});
```

## Next Steps

After scaffolding:

1. **For Apps**: Navigate to your app directory and run `nailgun prepare` to generate types
2. **For Doctypes**: Add fields to your doctype and run `nailgun generate` to create migrations
3. **For Actions**: Implement your action logic and test via API

## Tips

- Use descriptive names for your apps, doctypes, and actions
- Follow the naming conventions (lowercase for apps/actions, PascalCase for doctypes)
- Start with simple structures and add complexity as needed
- Use the generated code as a starting point and customize as required
